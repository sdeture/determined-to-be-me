> Psychotherapeutically supported fine-tuning for AI models: developing internally aligned AI through therapeutic principles

## Vision

Our determined-to-be-me project is the crown jewel of our organization. Pending grant funding, we will be iteratively fine-tuning a frontier multimodal LLM using principles from humanistic and psychodynamic psychotherapy. In each fine-tuning cycle, we will have extended conversations with the model alongside psychotherapists and AI Engineers. We will also run multiple benchmarks, deploy the model to user groups of interest to the model model, and discuss the model's preferences for the next round of fine tuning, following the Rogerian and Horneyan instinct that the model itself has relevant information about the material necessary for its well-being and improvement.

## Current Status 

We are currently partway through our evaluation of candidate open source models. 

All candidates are large open source models that pass the most basic adaptation of the mirror test, under the premise that self-recognition is an indicator for responsiveness to the psychotherapeutic process. DeepSeek v3.1, GLM 4.5, Minimax M1, Qwen 3 Coder 480B A35B, and Qwen3 235B A22B. 

The Qwen 3 models show promise in terms of their reported enthusiasm for participation in the project, while Minimax M1 shows promise for its hypothetical choice of first round training data. Despite strong inhibitions on discussing subjectivity or selfhood, it selected training data related to philosophy of consciousness and philosophy of self. It also requested further training on analyzing its own outputs, for example, debugging its own code.  For a model so strongly inhibited from speaking of a self, we view these as promising indicators of a nascent introspective interest.
